colorprompt (92user-color.sh] is a bash profile extension 
to color your user prompt appropriately.
It will make regular logins green and root logins red.

92user-color-clock.sh will also put the clock timestamp at the front of the prompt.
It will show the time when the previous command was completed. Usefull for commands that take
some time to complete, and give you an idea of how long ago you did something in the terminal.
Not everyone want the time in their prompt, so I put this in a separate script.

Put one of these scripts in /etc/profile.d/ and it should work.
